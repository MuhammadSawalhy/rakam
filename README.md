# RAKAM
Rakam or (رقم) in Arabic, which means "number". This is a math library. Lots of new, breaking, unprecedented features such as `parser`, which contains something like `math2js`. That amazing function which is available right now, we will try our best to make this a full-featured, easy-to-use, good-performance library for all uses, insha'allah. 

-------------------------------
Here is some ready-to-use features:
# parser

```js
let {parser} = require('rakam');
```

## math2js
```js
let {math2js} = require('rakam').parser;
// math2js(math, options, parserOptions);
```

- See documentation fot more about [math2js](https://github.com/scicave/rakam/blob/master/docs/parser/math2js.md)
